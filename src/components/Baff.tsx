              BAFF {"'"}24 event is an annual event and the first of its kind in
              the history of Nigeria, where citizens in a state are gathered by
              a corporate body with the support of the state government to learn
              about road traffic regulations, safety tips and there importance
              for free. The event aims to address critical issues related to
              traffic management and promote road safety awareness within our
              state. It is a gathering that will bring everybody together; both
              road users, young and old, businesses, traders, vendors and people
              of all walks of life between the ages of 15 {"-"} 65years from all
              over the city.

              The event is an edutainment initiative aimed at ensuring a
              wholesome driving culture for the well-being of our communities.
              There will be a 30-minute lecture each by the FRSC Oyo State
              Command, V.I.O, Oyo state traffic management authority (OYSTMA) on
              common safety tips on our roads, adherence to road signs and
              markings and their importance in ensuring our well-being. We
              believe this event will be a strategic way to sensitize our people
              on safety tips and there importance on our roads. A lot of drivers
              were taught through informal way such as relatives, mechanic,
              friends etc. leaving them to the ignorance of traffic regulations.
              This ignorance has caused lots of road crashes involving severe
              injuries and death.

            <p className="text-[16px] text-[#333] text-center">
              Most drivers on our roads cannot identify and interpret correctly
              the Nigeria highway codes, they have always believed it's not
              necessary and anything goes. That&apos;s why we have a lot of
              impatient drivers on our roads today because they don&apos;t know
              what it means to give right of way to those that deserve it. Some
              drivers that went to driving school did that only to get a
              practical knowledge, most didn&apos;t attend the theory classes
              believing it&apos;s not necessary. Market women believe the walk
              way is not necessarily for pedestrians and could be use by them to
              arrange their goods while pedestrians walk on the main road
              without caution.
